The rubric test case for the "If the flight is delayed due to airline fault, the passenger receives a credit of 1.5X the amount they paid" is shown in the flight surely truffle test - "Credited passenger can withdraw ether(transfer from airline to passenger". 

I am finding it difficult to replicate the same in the front end as I have little knowledge of front end coding. But the functionality is the same that has been implemented in the truffle test. I hope it will suffice.
